Hello world, for the first time I suppose? How does somebody even write a good blog?
<br></br>
I guess I will soon figure it out... but for now, here are some ramblings on the year 2024 while the year is still
new.

<section
        className="flex flex-wrap max-w-screen-xl w-full *:m-2 *:border-slate-500 *:border-8 *:p-5 m-8 *:flex-1 *:min-w-fit *:shadow-md">
    <div>
        <h2 className="underline">Career</h2>
        <p>
            Quite good, on the whole. Passed GCSEs with flying colours, got into some nice events, but I feel like
            mid 2022-late 2023 was my renaissance period; what I've done in 2024 is not at all close to those years.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2 className="underline">Life</h2>
        <p>
            I got a new brother!? He is a baby. ðŸ‘¶ Quite fun.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2 className="underline">Mood</h2>
        <p>
            I feel better about 2025 than I do compared to 2024.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2 className="underline">Culture</h2>
        <aside className="text-sm text-slate-500 -translate-y-2 border-slate-500 border-l-4 pl-1">
            This is about the culture I have consumed in 2024, not necessarily released in 2024.
        </aside>
        <ul className="*:m-4 *:mx-6 flex flex-wrap w-fit *:flex-1 *:min-w-96">
            <li>Persona 3 Reload, a remake of Persona 3, was released. I've been a Persona fan ever since I played
                Persona 5. P3:R is the best way to play Persona 3.</li>
            <li>I have already dumped 50 hours into Marvel Rivals, which was released only on December 2nd of 2024.
                Wow!</li>
            <li>I never watched the original Avengers. I will eventually get through the first phase of the MCU by
                the end of this year, I hope. I started with a few movies.</li>
            <li>I played a bit of Black Myth: Wukong, but I never really saw what others saw in it.</li>
            <li>I played a bit of Devil May Cry 5 in late 2023, but I didn't get to finish it this year.</li>
            <li className="special">I played Nine Sols. I <b>really</b> loved it, that game did not get enough love.</li>
            <li>I enjoyed Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Trilogy, but I think it is way overpriced. Get it on sale.</li>
            <li className="special">God of War: Ragnarok is a cinematic masterpiece.</li>
            <li>Squid Game 2 was alright</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2 className="underline">State of the world</h2>
        <p>
            I feel very pessimistic about it. Everyone who is in power absolutely should not be, and those who
            should be in power do very little with their power.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2 className="underline">Personal Growth</h2>

        <p>
            I feel like I have grown as a person this year quite a lot. I at least started putting in hard work into
            my
            academics, which is something that I have never done before. GCSEs I thought were quite easy to coast
            through.
            A Levels definitely stressed me out, because even when I was studying more than I ever had before (from
            &le;1 hours per week to &ge;6 hours),
            and giving it my all, I did not get the results I expected.
        </p>
            <br></br>
        <p>
            Something that I have come to realize over the past three months is that my grades
            are <em>not</em> a function of: <code className="py-2 text-center bg-orange-300"> more time &prop; more
            grades</code>.
            Eventually, after getting terrible result after terrible result and getting so stressed to the point of
            being driven to tears by my growing mountain of failures, I eventually... just gave up? It was around
            this
            time that my baby brother was born, so I had an excuse to ditch my routine of going to the library
            straight
            after school every day to grind through my subjects until 8 PM. Incidentally, it was around this time
            that
            my grades started to return to their usual levels. You could argue that my hard work was finally paying
            off,
            or you could alternatively argue that I was unnecessarily stressing myself out and jeopardizing my own
            success.
        </p>
            <br></br>
        <p>
            Not to suggest that lack of work is what helps you attain good grades, but don't overwork yourself. Your
            grades are
            not a function of more work &rarr; more good. It's the net outcome of your whole life, so don't stress
            yourself out
            working until 9 PM everyday, because that's probably what's making your grades tank.
        </p>
            <br></br>
        <p>
            Anyways, who am I to say anything? I'm only a first-year A Level student, so I'm sure that there are
            plenty more horrors to come my way!
