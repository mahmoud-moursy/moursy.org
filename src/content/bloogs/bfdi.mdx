### What is BFDI?

This article will probably be a bit shorter than most. I think I want to start a lineup of smaller blogs called "blurbs".
<br></br>
It's a show that I've been watching since I about six? It started out as an indie YouTube animated series, and it still
is a YouTube animated series, except they've grown since then and I don't think "indie" would fit the team anymore,
although the show still has a very home-grown feel.
<br></br>
To commemorate their 15-year anniversary, they recently published a very fun episode in one of the spin-offs (The Power of Two) where
the characters had to go back in time to many of the previous episodes across the show's numerous seasons to fix the timeline after it was broken.
<br></br>
BFDI is already known for its very good continuity, but I think this episode was probably one of the best in terms of that.
It's not the first time the show has revisited its oldest episodes, but I think this is the best iteration of that.
<br></br>
In retrospect, I forgot to include that in the culture section of my [New Year's Article](/bloog/posts/a-new-year-2025).
